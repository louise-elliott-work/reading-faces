            <p>This game can be used by children of all ages who are struggling to recognise different emotions. The aim of the game is to match up the photos portraying an emotion with the correct name of the emotion. For the purposes of this beta version, 10 emotions have been included. Future versions could be based on a more comprehensive set of emotional categories and names, for example those set out by Robert Plutchik's wheel of emotions.</p>
            <p>Using the game regularly may help reduce anxiety around understanding other people's feelings. The timer and score elements are optional and the reference sheet can be used to support children by allowing increased opportunity for success.</p>
            <p>It may be helpful for this activity to be modelled by an adult beforehand and for the adult to discuss with the child the different emotions they are seeing.</p>
